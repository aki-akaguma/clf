This is a Rust library that provides a way to flush the CPU cache line. It wraps the `__builtin_clear_cache()` function, which is available in `gcc` and `clang`. The library exposes two functions: `cache_line_flush_with_ptr` and `cache_line_flush_with_slice`. The first takes a raw pointer and a length, while the second takes a slice. The library is designed to be used in benchmarks that are not dependent on the CPU cache. It supports a variety of architectures, including x86_64, aarch64, mips64el, and powerpc64le. It is licensed under the MIT or Apache-2.0 license.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

*   The library must provide a function to flush the CPU cache line for a given memory region.
*   The library must provide a function that takes a raw pointer and a length as arguments.
*   The library must provide a function that takes a slice as an argument.
*   The library must support both `gcc` and `clang` compilers.
*   The library must support the x86_64, aarch64, mips64el, and powerpc64le architectures.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

*   The library must be written in Rust.
*   The library must be licensed under the MIT or Apache-2.0 license.
*   The library must be published on crates.io.
*   The library must have a README.md file that explains how to use the library.
*   The library must have a CHANGELOG.md file that lists the changes in each version of the library.
*   The library must have a build script that compiles the C code.
*   The library must have a test suite that tests the functionality of the library.
*   The library must be compatible with the latest stable version of Rust.
*   The library must be able to be compiled on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
