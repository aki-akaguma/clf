### Design

#### Overview

The `clf` library is a Rust crate that provides a simple interface to flush the CPU cache line. It is designed to be used in benchmarks that are not dependent on the CPU cache. The library wraps the `__builtin_clear_cache()` function, which is available in `gcc` and `clang`.

#### Architecture

The library is composed of two main parts:

1.  **A Rust library:** This library provides the public API for the `clf` crate. It consists of two functions: `cache_line_flush_with_ptr` and `cache_line_flush_with_slice`.
2.  **A C library:** This library provides the implementation of the `_cache_line_flush` function. This function is a wrapper around the `__builtin_clear_cache()` function.

#### Components

*   **`lib.rs`:** This file contains the Rust code for the `clf` library. It defines the public API and calls the C functions.
*   **`clf.c`:** This file contains the C code for the `_cache_line_flush` function. This function is a wrapper around the `__builtin_clear_cache()` function.
*   **`clf-void.c`:** This file contains a stub implementation of the `_cache_line_flush` function. This is used when the `__builtin_clear_cache()` function is not available.
*   **`build.rs`:** This file is a build script that compiles the C code and links it to the Rust library.

#### Data Flow

The data flow is as follows:

1.  The user calls one of the public functions in the `clf` library.
2.  The public function calls the `_cache_line_flush` function in the C library.
3.  The `_cache_line_flush` function calls the `__builtin_clear_cache()` function.
4.  The `__builtin_clear_cache()` function flushes the CPU cache line.
